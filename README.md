SIT323-2025-Prac4P - Calculator Microservice

In this project, I created a simple calculator microservice using Node.js and Express Framework. It does the following operations:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

Each operation is accessible through the following endpoints:
- `/add`: Adds two numbers.
- `/subtract`: Subtracts one number from another.
- `/multiply`: Multiplies two numbers.
- `/divide`: Divides one number by another (division by zero results in an error).
